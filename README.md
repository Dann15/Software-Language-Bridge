# Software Language Bridge
In layman terms, the Software Language Bridge tool (referred to as SLB) will allow for programming languages to be connected with other programming languages with ease.

This tool will allow for projects that use multiple programming languages to have a bridge between them, such that the languages are able to communicate with each other in an efficient and reliable manner. Whilst this tool is being made for Java & Python based projects (we plan to expand in the future), this tool can be most-definitely be expanded to other programming languages.

By taking a look through the code, and by reading the guide, the process of having to make a "bridge" that are identical and therefore compatiable to our preset bridges should become an ease.

## Usages
Whilst this tool may, in some circumstances, not be of much use to programmers, there are many significant applications in which such a tool is to be much desired. This desire is most-notably found when with microcontrollers such as the Raspberry Pi.

Many complicated APIs for the Raspberry Pi are only Python compatable, and in a situation in which you are not a fluent Python programmer and you need to also be working with Java, this tool can come in great help to link the two programming languages together.

However, whilst in this example, we had solely mentioned linkages between Java & Python, linkages between any languages are possible with the way that we had designed our "bridge" system.
