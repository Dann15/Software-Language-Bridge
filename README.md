# Software Language Bridge
In layman terms, the Software Language Bridge tool (referred to as SLB) will allow for programming languages to be connected with other programming languages with ease.

This tool will allow for projects that use multiple programming languages to have a bridge between them, such that the languages are able to communicate with each other in an efficient and reliable manner. Whilst this tool is being made for Java & Python based projects (we plan to expand in the future), this tool can be most-definitely be expanded to other programming languages.

By taking a look through the code, and by reading the guide, the process of having to make a "bridge" that are identical and therefore compatiable to our preset bridges should become an ease.
